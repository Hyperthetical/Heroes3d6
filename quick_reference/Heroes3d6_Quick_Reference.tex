\section{Natural Attributes}
These reflect various aspects of the character's personality and consist of: \textlf{Might}, \textlf{Cunning}, \textlf{Wit}, and \textlf{Resolve}.

\textlf{Might} is the character's aggression, \textlf{Cunning} is a measure of their craftiness, \textlf{Wit} is their alertness and attention to detail,  and \textlf{Resolve} their force of will and personal magnetism.

\subsection{Attribute Scores}
These vary between 0 and 3, with higher being better.

\section{Heroic Attributes}
\subsection{Heroism}
This is the characters capacity for heroic actions and is tracked in terms of available points. These can be spent on heroic efforts, which either guarantee success on a chosen action or add a level of \textlf{critical success}. Additionally, a character can use a point to benefit from a single \textlf{perk} of their choice for 1 round (no need to know or have it equipped to do this). If you had no \textlf{Heroism} remaining, then you regain one point when resting. Otherwise, the Game Master is free to reward clever moves, heroic behaviour, or good role-playing with a point of \textlf{Heroism}.

\section{Perks}
These represent talents gained while adventuring and can be purchased at the cost of experience.

\textlf{Perks} are divided into two categories: active and passive. Active \textlf{perks} alter the kind of actions your character can take. Passive \textlf{perks} provide their bonuses all the time. A single character can only have 3 active and 3 passive \textlf{perks} equipped at a time. They can still have \textlf{perks} purchased but these effects do not apply unless equipped. Changing equipped \textlf{perks} requires 1 hour of rest. There are slots on the character sheet for you to note your currently equipped \textlf{perks} in.

\section{Edge}
When rolling 3d6 with an \textlf{edge} bonus (\textlf{edge+}), a character rolls 4d6 and chooses the highest 3. In contrast, an \textlf{edge} penalty (\textlf{edge-}) makes the character roll 4d6 dice and choose the lowest 3.  The general pattern is: when rolling $n$d6 and having $m$ \textlf{edge} bonuses/penalties, you instead roll $(n+m)$d6 and choose the highest/lowest $n$ dice. 

\section{Difficulty Checks}
A \textlf{difficulty check} is made using a given \textlf{Attribute} or \textlf{Skill}. In order to succeed you must roll equal to or higher than the \textlf{Difficulty} on 3d6, adding the appropriate \textlf{Attribute} score.

\section{Opposed Rolls}
Each of the creatures contesting the roll adds the given score to the result of 3d6. The winner is the one with the highest total. Re-roll if it is a tie.


\section{Skills and Professions}

How to use a skill:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Roll 3d6, adding synergy attribute (this has \textlf{edge-} if not proficient)
\item
If the roll equals or exceeds the \textlf{Difficulty}, the \textlf{skill} use is successful, and if it exceeds the \textlf{Difficulty} by $\dicecritlvl$ or more it is a \textlf{critical success}. Failing by $\dicecritlvl$ or more produces a \textlf{critical failure}. 
\item
These results have direct effect upon how well the desired task is achieved (see the skill rules for detailed consequences).
\end{itemize}


\section{Combat}

\subsection{A round of combat}
A round of combat can be summarised simply as
\begin{enumerate}
	\item All combat participants declare intended actions (2 action points each)
	\item Each side in combat rolls 1d6
	\item Resolve actions for each side in order of the 1d6 roll
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Combat actions}
A list of possible actions in combat is given below, the action point cost is given in brackets.

\subsubsection{Move (1)}
The character can transfer between adjacent combat areas (10 m of movement) and thus has range 1. Leaving a combat area that contains enemies provokes a \textlf{moment of weakness}. 

\subsubsection{Run (2)}
The character can \textlf{move} with + 1 range (+10 m) and gains \textlf{edge+} on \textlf{deflect}.  

\subsubsection{Retreat (2)}
The character can leave a combat area that contains an enemy without suffering a \textlf{moment of weakness}. 

\subsubsection{Attack (1)}
Make an opposed roll with \textlf{aim} versus the target's \textlf{deflect} (you have \textlf{edge-} if not proficient with your weapon). If you win, make a \textlf{damage check} for each of your weapons by rolling with your \textlf{power} versus target's \textlf{toughness}. Many \textlf{perks} can enhance or alter attacks. This costs 2 action points if using two weapons.

\subsubsection{All-out attack (2)}  
Same procedure as an attack but make 1 extra damage roll. This costs 3 action points if using two weapons.

\subsubsection{Shove (1)}
Opposed \textlf{might} check with target. If you win, they are \textlf{knocked down} or moved into an adjacent combat area (at the shover's discretion), otherwise you suffer a \textlf{moment of weakness} on \textlf{critical failure}.

\subsubsection{Feint (1)}
Opposed \textlf{cunning} check with target. If you win, gain \textlf{edge+} on \textlf{aim}, otherwise you suffer a \textlf{moment of weakness} on \textlf{critical failure}.

\subsubsection{Grapple (1)}
Opposed \textlf{might} check with target. If you win, they cannot move, otherwise you suffer a \textlf{moment of weakness} on \textlf{critical failure}. The victim must make an opposed \textlf{Might} check (and spend 1 action point) to escape. It costs 1 action point each round after the first to maintain a grapple.

\subsubsection{Trip (1/2)}
Modified attack action where you sacrifice a \textlf{damage check}, instead make an opposed \textlf{cunning} check. If you win, the victim is \textlf{knocked down}. Weapons with the \textlf{Trip} rule cause damage on a \textlf{critical success}. If an attack benefits from two copies of this rule then it deals damage as normal when tripping.

\subsubsection{Taunt [1]}
Make an opposed check with your \textlf{resolve} and the target's \textlf{wit}. If you win, the target now attempts to attack you instead other targets. 

\subsubsection{Disarm (1/2)}
Modified attack action where you sacrifice a \textlf{damage check}, instead make an opposed \textlf{wit} check. If you win, the victim cannot use their equipped weapon without spending 1 action point or suffering a \textlf{moment of weakness} to retrieve it. Weapons with the \textlf{disarm} rule cause damage on a \textlf{critical success}. If an attack benefits from two copies of this rule then it deals damage as normal when disarming.

\subsubsection{Defensive stance (1)}
The character gains \textlf{edge+} on \textlf{deflect} for the next attack they suffer.

\subsubsection{Combat Attributes}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\textlf{Aim} & = & \textlf{wit} \\ 
\textlf{Deflect} & = & \textlf{Cunning}\\
\textlf{Power} & = & Weapon Bonus +\textlf{might}\\
\textlf{Toughness} & = & 8 + armour value\\
\textlf{endurance} & = & 2 + \textlf{resolve} \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Additional attacks rules} 
Note that only 1 attack-type action can be made per turn.

\subsubsection{Penetrating hits}
These are scored if a fighter fails a \textlf{Deflect} attempt by $\dicecritlvl$ or more. A \textlf{Penetrating Hit} grants \textlf{edge+} on the subsequent damage rolls.

\subsection{Damage checks}
Are a difficulty check using the \textlf{Power} of the attack against a \textlf{difficulty} given by the target's \textlf{Toughness} (you have \textlf{edge-} if not proficient with your weapon). A successful \textlf{damage check} results in the target losing 1 \textlf{endurance} per point of \textlf{lethality} on the attack (default 1). If they run out of \textlf{endurance} then increment their \textlf{wound level} instead.

\subsubsection{Critical hits}
For every $\dicecritlvl$ the \textlf{damage check} exceeds the target's \textlf{toughness} by, the attack gains a + 1 \textlf{Lethality}.


\subsection{Wound levels}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\textlf{Wounded} inflicts \textlf{stunned} effect on the victim (attack actions cost 1 extra action point). 
	\item
	A \textlf{Badly Wounded} causes \textlf{edge-} on all actions in addition to \textlf{wounded} effects.
	\item 
	A \textlf{Mortally Wounded} effect means the character cannot make actions and will die within 3 days without treatment.
	\item 
	A \textlf{dead} character is dead.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recovery and Healing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	1 \textlf{endurance} is restored by 1 hour rest or a hot meal.
	\item 
	All \textlf{endurance} is restored via a night's sleep.
	\item 
	The \textlf{leadership skill} can restore \textlf{endurance}
	\item 
	Restoring \textlf{endurance} has no effect on a target's \textlf{wound level}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Wounds can be healed via use of the \textlf{Healing} skill or by a non-player healer.
	\item
	A character heals from the \textlf{Wounded} effect after 3 days. \textlf{Badly Wounded} down-grades to \textlf{wounded} after 7 days.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Reactions}

\subsubsection{Desperate effort}
This costs 1 reaction point and can be used when the character fails a check in combat (not including \textlf{skill} checks). This allows the character to re-roll the check, they must accept the result of this re-roll. This cannot be used if the character has any \textlf{edge} bonuses on the roll. 

\subsubsection{Exploit weakness}
This costs 1 reaction point and can be used when an enemy within range 0 experiences a \textlf{moment of weakness}. This allows the character to make a single close combat \textlf{damage check} (with their equipped weapon) against the enemy.



\section{Terrain and Cover}
Moving through \textlf{Rough} or \textlf{Dangerous} terrain has the following consequences:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\textlf{Rough} terrain: Moving in or out costs 1 action point more than normal.
\item 
\textlf{Dangerous} terrain: Causes hit with \textlf{crushing lethality} on a 3d6 roll $\dicediffbase+$ regardless of \textlf{toughness}. Moving in or out costs 1 action point more than normal.
\end{itemize}
When hiding behind/in cover the character receives a bonus to their \textlf{Deflect} checks.
